# Rules for Creating Tests

*   **Odd/Even Number Rule:** Test cases should only use odd numbers as starting values. Even numbers should be excluded.
*   **Read Before Overwriting:** Before overwriting any test file, carefully read its contents to understand the existing test case and avoid unintended data loss.
