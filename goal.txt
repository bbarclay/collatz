CORE MISSION: PATTERN DISCOVERY

Primary Objective:
Discover new structural patterns in Collatz sequences that might reveal
deeper mathematical relationships governing the conjecture.

Investigation Framework:
1. Focus on pattern discovery, not proof validation
2. Look for self-similar structures and recurring patterns
3. Study relationship networks between numbers
4. Map trajectory families and their properties

Critical Rules:
1. Never use 1 or even numbers as starting values
2. Document ALL patterns, even if they seem insignificant
3. Look for connections between seemingly unrelated patterns
4. Focus on structural relationships over individual numbers

Success Metrics:
1. New pattern discoveries
2. Unexplained regularities
3. Novel relationship structures
4. Potential invariant properties

Remember: We're not trying to prove the conjecture directly.
We're mapping its underlying structure through pattern discovery.
