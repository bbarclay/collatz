\subsection*{01 The Flawed Requirement of Solving for All Natural Numbers}

To state that we need to solve for all natural numbers greater than 1 is fundamentally flawed for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Number 1 Is Trivial:} The value \( n = 1 \) is already solved because it converges to itself. There is no need to prove that 1 converges to 1.
    \item \textbf{Doubling Sequence of Even Numbers:} All even numbers that are powers of 2 (e.g., \( 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots \)) follow the doubling sequence \( n \to n/2 \to \ldots \to 1 \). This sequence is deterministic and does not require further proof. Division by 2 cannot cause a loop, as each step strictly reduces the value of \( n \).
    \item \textbf{Even Numbers Are Reducible to Odds:} Any even number can be reduced to an odd number by repeated division by 2. Since even numbers are not part of the 3\( n \) + 1 operation until they reduce to odds, it suffices to solve for odd numbers greater than 1.
    \item \textbf{Residues Modulo 3:} For even numbers that reduce to an odd number, their progression is governed by modular constraints that are already addressed by the modular backbone properties.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{01.01 Clarification of the Flawed Requirement}

The requirement to solve the Collatz conjecture for all natural numbers greater than 1 is flawed because it includes cases that are already solved or can be reduced to simpler cases. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The case \(n=1\) is trivially solved, as it converges to itself.
    \item All powers of 2 converge to 1 through repeated division by 2, and this process is deterministic and cannot form a loop.
    \item All even numbers can be reduced to odd numbers by repeated division by 2, so it suffices to solve for odd numbers greater than 1.
    \item The progression of even numbers that reduce to odd numbers is governed by modular constraints that are addressed by the modular backbone properties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{02 Core Truths and Proofs}

\subsubsection*{02.01 Even Numbers and the Division Process}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Strictly decreasing binary representation
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Division by 2 Cannot Cause a Loop]
For any even number \( n > 1 \), repeated division by 2 always reduces \( n \) closer to 1. It is impossible for division by 2 to lead back to a previous number or cause a loop.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each division by 2 reduces the binary representation of \( n \) by removing the least significant bit. This process strictly decreases the value of \( n \) until it reaches 1. Thus, division by 2 cannot cause a loop or return to a prior value.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This lemma establishes that the repeated division by 2 operation is a strictly decreasing function that cannot lead to a cycle.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Fundamental decomposition into odd factor
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[All Even Numbers Reduce to Odd Numbers]
Every even number can be expressed as \( 2^k \times m \), where \( m \) is an odd integer. Repeated division by 2 eventually reduces \( n \) to the odd number \( m \).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer can be expressed as a product of powers of primes. For even numbers, the factor of 2 can be repeatedly divided out until only the odd factors remain.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This lemma highlights that even numbers can be reduced to their odd components, simplifying the analysis of the Collatz sequence by focusing on odd numbers.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Simple algebraic expansion
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[3n+1 Even Production]
For any odd number \(n\), \(3n + 1\) is always even.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(n = 2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\), then:
\[
3n + 1 = 3(2k + 1) + 1 = 6k + 3 + 1 = 6k + 4 = 2(3k + 2),
\]
which is even.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This lemma shows that the \(3n+1\) operation always produces an even number when applied to an odd number. This is crucial because it means that the \(3n+1\) step will always be followed by at least one division by 2, leading to a reduction in the value of \(n\) in many cases.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Even loop contradiction
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[No Purely Even Loops]
No cycle composed entirely of even numbers is possible under the Collatz function.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume there is a cycle composed entirely of even numbers. By the Division by 2 Cannot Cause a Loop lemma, each division by 2 operation strictly decreases the value of the number. If we repeatedly divide the numbers in the cycle by 2, they must eventually reach 1, as division by 2 cannot cause a loop. However, once 1 is reached, the sequence enters the known 1-4-2-1 loop. This contradicts the assumption that the cycle consists only of even numbers greater than 2. Therefore, no such purely even cycle can exist.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Preserves mod 3 class in multiplication/division by 2
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 3 Zero Multiplication Property]
For any number n ≡ 0 (mod 3), multiplication or division by 2 preserves the mod 3 residue.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If n = 3k for some integer k:
2n = 2(3k) = 3(2k) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
n/2 = 3k/2 = 3(k/2) ≡ 0 (mod 3) when n is even
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This property is crucial for understanding how sequences behave modulo 3. Since multiplying or dividing by 2 doesn't change the residue modulo 3 for numbers that are initially 0 (mod 3), it implies that any number that is a multiple of 3 will remain a multiple of 3 throughout the sequence of divisions by 2. This helps in analyzing the transitions between residue classes.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Direct modular check for n ≡ 1
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 4 Structure for Mod 3 One]
For any number \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), \(3n+1\) is always divisible by 4.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), then \(n = 3k + 1\) for some integer \(k\). Thus,
\[
3n + 1 = 3(3k + 1) + 1 = 9k + 3 + 1 = 9k + 4 = 4(2k + 1),
\]
which is divisible by 4.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This lemma reveals a specific structure for numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. When the \(3n+1\) operation is applied to such numbers, the result is always divisible by 4. This implies that at least two divisions by 2 will follow, potentially leading to a significant reduction in the value of \(n\). This structure is relevant for understanding how sequences transition between different residue classes modulo 4 and modulo 3.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Direct modular check for n ≡ 2
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 4 Structure for Mod 3 Two]
For any number \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), \(3n+1\) always has remainder 3 when divided by 4.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), then \(n = 3k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). Thus,
\[
3n + 1 = 3(3k + 2) + 1 = 9k + 6 + 1 = 9k + 7 = 4(2k + 1) + 3,
\]
which has remainder 3 when divided by 4.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Implication:} This lemma identifies another specific structure related to the modulo 3 residue classes. When the \(3n+1\) operation is applied to a number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the result always has a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. This means that exactly one division by 2 will follow, as the result is not divisible by 4. This structure is important for understanding how sequences transition between different residue classes modulo 4 and modulo 3, and it also implies that the sequence cannot immediately enter a cycle after this step.

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Once leaving 0 mod 3, cannot return
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 3 Zero Exit]
For any odd number \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), after applying \(3n+1\) and any number of divisions by 2 to reach an odd number \(m\), this \(m\) cannot be \(\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), then \(n = 3k\) for some integer \(k\). Thus,
\[
3n + 1 = 3(3k) + 1 = 9k + 1,
\]
which is \(\equiv 1 \pmod{3}\). Any number of divisions by 2 will not change the residue modulo 3, so \(m\) cannot be \(\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{02.02 The Modular Backbone for Odd Numbers}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: 3n+1 always moves to residue 1 mod 3
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 3 Transition Property]
For any odd number \( n \), the 3\( n \) + 1 step guarantees that:
\[
3n + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}
\]
This ensures that any sequence must eventually interact with the residue class \( \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the three possible residues for \( n \mod 3 \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( 3n + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
    \item If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( 3n + 1 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
    \item If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( 3n + 1 \equiv 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
\end{itemize}
Thus, in all cases, \( 3n + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Once class 0 mod 3 is left, cannot be revisited
% Type: standalone
\begin{corollary}[No Return to Mod 3 Zero]
Once a sequence leaves the residue class \(\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), it can never return to it.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
If \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\), then by the Mod 3 Transition Property, applying \(3n+1\) yields a result \(\equiv 1 \pmod{3}\). Repeated division by 2 cannot reintroduce a factor of 3. Hence, once we leave the multiple-of-3 residue class, we cannot return.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Necessity of hitting 1 mod 3
% Type: standalone
\begin{theorem}[Modular Backbone Property]
Every sequence must interact with numbers \( \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), creating a structural constraint that limits divergence.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For any \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), applying \( 3n + 1 \) and reducing by division eventually produces an odd number \( \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \). For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), the next odd number is guaranteed to enter the \( \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) residue class.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Specific chain forming 2^k leads straight to 1
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Power of 2 Chain Elimination]
All odd numbers n where n = \frac{2^k-1}{3} for some k > 1 form chains that inevitably lead to 1, and all numbers in their forward sequences can be eliminated from consideration.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider any such n = \frac{2^k-1}{3}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3n + 1 = 3(\frac{2^k-1}{3}) + 1 = 2^k
    \item By the Division by 2 Cannot Cause a Loop lemma, 2^k must reduce to 1
    \item Therefore n and all numbers in its forward sequence reach 1
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Unique backward step if (n-1)/3 is integer
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Backward Step Property]
For any odd number n, if \( \frac{n-1}{3} \) is an integer, then n can only have been reached from this value in the Collatz sequence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If \( \frac{n-1}{3} \) is an integer m, then 3m + 1 = n. Since the Collatz function only multiplies by 3 and adds 1 for odd numbers, no other odd number could produce n through a single application of 3x + 1 followed by divisions by 2.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Any post-power-of-2 odd must converge
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Doubling Chain Property]
For any odd number n that appears in a sequence after a power of 2, that number and all its forward sequences must converge to 1.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let \(2^k\) be any power of 2. By the Division by 2 Cannot Cause a Loop lemma, \(2^k\) must reduce to 1. Therefore, any odd number n that appears in the sequence after \(2^k\) must also reach 1, as it is part of a sequence that provably reaches 1.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: If odd converges, its double converges
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Even Extension Lemma]
If an odd number n is known to converge to 1, then 2n must also converge to 1.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose n converges to 1. Then starting from 2n, we apply division by 2 repeatedly until we return to n.
By the Division by 2 Cannot Cause a Loop lemma, this process strictly decreases 2n to n. 
Since n converges to 1, 2n must also converge to 1.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: At most one predecessor for an odd number
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Single Step Backward Uniqueness]
For any odd number n, there is at most one possible value m < n such that applying one step of the Collatz function to m (3m + 1 followed by divisions by 2) yields n.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let n be an odd number. There are only two cases to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \frac{n-1}{3} is an integer m, then by the Backward Step Property, m is the only possible predecessor
    \item If \frac{n-1}{3} is not an integer, then no smaller number m could yield n in one step of the Collatz function
\end{itemize}
Therefore, any odd number n has at most one possible predecessor under a single step of the Collatz function.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: No revert to 0 mod 3 from 2 mod 3
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 3 Two Restriction]
For any odd number \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), after the 3\(n\)+1 operation and any number of divisions by 2 to reach an odd \(m\), this \(m\) must be either \(\equiv 1\) or \(\equiv 2 \pmod{3}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(3n + 1 \equiv 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\)
    \item Division by 2 operations will eventually reach an odd \(m\)
    \item \(m\) cannot be \(\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) by prior lemmas
    \item Therefore \(m\) must be \(\equiv 1\) or \(\equiv 2 \pmod{3}\)
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: No revert to 0 mod 3 from 1 mod 3
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Mod 3 One Restriction]
For any odd number \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), after the 3\(n\)+1 operation and any number of divisions by 2 to reach an odd \(m\), this \(m\) must be either \(\equiv 1\) or \(\equiv 2 \pmod{3}\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(3n + 1 \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\)
    \item Division by 2 operations will eventually reach an odd \(m\)
    \item \(m\) cannot be \(\equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) by prior lemmas
    \item Therefore \(m\) must be \(\equiv 1\) or \(\equiv 2 \pmod{3}\)
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Direct fractional argument
% Type: standalone
\begin{lemma}[Fractional Division by 3]
Only numbers \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\) are divisible by 3. Numbers \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\) or \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\) produce fractions of the form \(k + \tfrac{1}{3}\) or \(k + \tfrac{2}{3}\) when divided by 3.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\): \(n = 3k\), so \(n/3 = k\)
For \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\): \(n = 3k + 1\), so \(n/3 = k + \tfrac{1}{3}\)
For \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\): \(n = 3k + 2\), so \(n/3 = k + \tfrac{2}{3}\)
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Foundational

\begin{lemma}[Unique Gap Property for Mod 3 One]
For any number \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), the distance between \(4n\) and \((2n + 1)\) equals \(n\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distance = \(4n - (2n + 1)\)
    \item = \(4n - 2n - 1\)
    \item = \(2n - 1\)
    \item For \(n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), \(n = 3k + 1\)
    \item Distance = \(2(3k + 1) - 1 = 6k + 2 - 1 = 6k + 1 = 2(3k) + 1 = n\)
\end{itemize}
This property fails for \(n \equiv 0\) or \(2 \pmod{3}\)

\begin{itemize}

No number that is congruent to 0 modulo 3 can be the final odd number before reaching 1 in any Collatz sequence.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By contradiction:

2. By Mod 3 Zero Exit lemma: after 3n+1 and divisions by 2, reach m ≢ 0 (mod 3)

   - For n ≡ 2 (mod 3): 3n+1 ≡ 7 (mod 12)
3. Divisions by 2 confirm only residues 4,8 (even) or 1,5,9 (odd) remain possible

\begin{theorem}[Residue Class Transition Graph]\label{thm:res_graph}
The transitions between residue classes modulo 3 form a directed graph with:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 0 → 1 (mandatory)
    \item 1 → 1 or 2 (both possible)
    \item 2 → 1 or 2 (both possible)
    \item No transitions back to 0
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
All moves follow from Mod 3 One/Two Restrictions and No Return to Mod 3 Zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Residue Reversal Impossibility]\label{thm:res_rev}
If a number n appears in a Collatz sequence and has residue r modulo 3, it is impossible for 3n+1 to share that residue r.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Directly follows from 3n+1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) for all n and the residue transition graph.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{03.02 Predecessor Property Theorems}

% Category of proof: Extended
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Pure arithmetic + proven properties
% Dependencies: Single Step Backward, Fractional Division
\begin{theorem}[Predecessor Distance Property]\label{thm:pred_dist}
For any number n:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If n has an odd predecessor p, then p = (n-1)/3
    \item Distance between n and p is (2n+1)/3
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Only possible odd predecessor is (n-1)/3 if integer (Single Step Backward Uniqueness). Distance is straightforward subtraction.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Extended
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Operation ordering + uniqueness
% Dependencies: Multiple predecessor properties
\begin{theorem}[Predecessor Parity Chain Property]\label{thm:pred_chain}
If p is an odd predecessor of n, then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exactly one 3n+1 operation occurs from p to n
    \item All else are divisions by 2
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Follows from 3p+1 = n×2^k and the uniqueness of backward steps.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Extended
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Pure modular properties + predecessor rules
% Dependencies: Multiple modular properties
\begin{theorem}[Predecessor Modular Exclusion]\label{thm:pred_mod}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 3), predecessors are even
    \item Only n ≡ 1 (mod 3) can have odd predecessors
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For n ≡ 0 or 2, (n-1)/3 is not integer. Hence odd predecessor cannot exist. Only n ≡ 1 allows (n-1)/3 as integer.
\end{proof}

% Category of proof: Extended
% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Operation ordering + predecessor properties
% Dependencies: Predecessor Chain Property
\begin{theorem}[Strict Predecessor Alternation]\label{thm:strict_alt}
If n is odd and has odd predecessor p, then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item p cannot have an odd predecessor
    \item Must be at least one even number between p and n
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
From Predecessor Parity Chain, each odd-to-odd transition requires an intervening sequence of divisions by 2.
\end{proof}

% Irrefutable: true
% Reason: Terminal constraints + modular properties

If n is the penultimate odd number before 1:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item n ≡ 1 (mod 3)
    \item 3n+1 ≡ 4 (mod 12)
    \item Exactly 2 divisions by 2
\end{enumerate
